# Working with Google Maps in Angular

This repository holds the code sample for my blog post [Working with Google Maps in Angular](https://arminzia.com/blog/working-with-google-maps-in-angular/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.  
There are only a handful of dependencies:  
- [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [ngx-toastr](https://ngx-toastr.vercel.app/)
- [@angular/google-maps](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/master/src/google-maps)
- [@types/googlemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/googlemaps)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
